# Homework 5: Day Planner

## Usage

This program is a day planner that will allow you to make notes and plan each hour of the day. This planner tracks regular business hours (9AM to 5PM). Each hour will be color coded to reflect the current time of day. The block will be grey if the hour is past, red if the hour is current, and green if the hour is in the future. When you press the save button it will pull any text in all of the planner text boxes and save them to local storage which will then be loaded upon page load.
